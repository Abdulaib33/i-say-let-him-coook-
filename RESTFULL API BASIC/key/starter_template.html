    // LEVEL 1 â€” Core CRUD practice
    // These are direct one-method-per-function practice drills.


      // 1. GET (Read All)

      //   Goal: Fetch all posts, but display only their title fields as a numbered list.

      //   Steps:

      //     Use ky.get(API).json().

      //     Slice the array to the first 5 posts.

      //     Loop over them and log:



    // Place your exercise functions here
    // Example: 
    async function getAll() {
      // const data = await ky.get(API).json();
      // log('GET all', data.slice(0, 2));
    }



    // Run exercises here
    getAll();

<!-- 1. GET (Read All)

      Goal: Fetch all posts, but display only their title fields as a numbered list.

      Steps:

        Use ky.get(API).json().

        Slice the array to the first 5 posts.

        Loop over them and log:


        1. title of first post
        2. title of second post
        Do not show body or other properties.


2. GET (Read One)

    Goal: Fetch a single post by a given ID.

    Steps:

      Store let targetId = 7;

      Fetch API + '/' + targetId.

      Log only:


      Title: ...
      Body: ...


3. POST (Create)

    Goal: Create a new post.

    Steps:

      Use ky.post(API, { json: {...} }).

      Send { title: 'My Post', body: 'Some content', userId: 1 }.

      Log the new postâ€™s ID returned by the API.


4. PUT (Full Update)

    Goal: Replace all fields of an existing post.

    Steps:

      Pick id = 1.

      PUT to API + '/1' with:

      json

      { id: 1, title: 'Replaced Title', body: 'Completely new body', userId: 1 }
      Log the full updated object.


5. PATCH (Partial Update)

    Goal: Update only the title of a post.

    Steps:

      Pick id = 1.

      PATCH to API + '/1' with { title: 'Updated Only Title' }.

      Log the response and check body is unchanged.


6. DELETE

    Goal: Remove a post.

    Steps:

      Pick id = 1.

      ky.delete(API + '/1').

      Log "Deleted post 1" if status is 200 or 204.

      LEVEL 2 â€” Response handling & variations
      Now you combine fundamentals with error handling and variations.


7. Handle Errors Gracefully

    Goal: Avoid crashes when the API returns an error.

    Steps:

      Pick an impossible ID: id = 9999.

      Wrap await ky.get(API + '/9999') in try...catch.

      If 404, log "Post not found" instead of throwing.


8. Chain Requests

    Goal: Do one request, then use its result in the next.

    Steps:

      Create a post with POST.

      Extract its new id from the response.

      Immediately GET that new post to confirm it exists.

      Log both results.


9. Multiple GETs in Parallel

  Goal: Fetch multiple posts at the same time.

  Steps:

    Create array of IDs: [3, 4, 5].

    Use Promise.all() with ky.get(...).json() for each.

    Log an array of results.

10. Pagination Simulation

  Goal: Mimic API pagination on client side.

  Steps:

      Fetch all posts with GET.

      Group them into arrays of 3.

      For each group, log "Page 1:", "Page 2:", etc., with their titles.

      LEVEL 3 â€” Extra mastery
      These simulate dynamic, batch, and chained operations.


11. Dynamic ID from User Input

    Goal: Ask user for an ID and fetch that post.

    Steps:

      Use let id = prompt('Enter post ID:');

      Fetch that ID and log the title + body.

      If no post found, log "No such post".


12. Search Simulation

    Goal: Filter posts by keyword in the title.

    Steps:

      Fetch all posts.

      Filter where title.includes('qui').

      Log matching titles.


13. Batch Create

    Goal: Create multiple posts in a loop.

    Steps:

      Loop from 1 to 3.

      POST { title: 'Post ' + i, body: 'Body ' + i, userId: 1 }.

      Log each returned id.


14. Update After Create

    Goal: Create a post and then immediately update it.

    Steps:

      POST a new post.

      PATCH it with { title: 'Updated After Create' }.

      Log before & after results.


15. Delete All in Range

    Goal: Delete several posts by ID.

    Steps:

      IDs = [1, 2, 3].

      Loop and call DELETE for each.

      Log "Deleted ID: x" after each.
